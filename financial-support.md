Please note that funding will as a rule not be provided in advance of the meeting but by reimbursement after the meeting. Recognizing the lenghty time span between purchase of flight ticket and reimbursement of costs, the GBIF Secretariat offers the opportunity to reimburse flight costs straight after the tickets have been purchased, based on receipts, if needed. If applicants to not have the means to pre-finance the cost of a flight ticket, they may apply for GBIF to pay the air ticket costs directly.   

Please read the conditions section in the application form carefully. Non-compliance may result in loss of future travel reimbursement.  

The accommodation subsidy will be 100 Euro per night CHECK WITH JOE. GBIF will cover arrival the night before the start of the Governing Board meeting start and departure the day after the end of the meeting. The subsidy will be reimbursed after the meeting.   

If selected for funding, the GBIF Secretariat will send you the reimbursement form for the air ticket costs (if not already covered directly by GBIF) and the accommodation subsidy. The reimbursement form must be submitted together with proof of costs by no later than two months after the meeting.  

If you have any questions, please contact the GBIF Secretariat at [GB33@gbif.org](mailto:GB33@gbif.org).
